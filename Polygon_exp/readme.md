# Polygon Experiment

This project explores the behavior of polygons by manipulating the number of vertices based on arbitrary thresholds.

## Code Description

The code in this project is a little bit messy, but due to time constraints, it hasn't been cleaned up yet. However, it still serves the purpose of demonstrating the polygon experiments.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

0. Install SDL Library
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the code and observe the behavior of the polygons as the number of vertices grows or decreases.
